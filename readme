Steps to deploy nft
Below are the steps to setup for a launch of a nft

Part 1 - Asset creation and preperation

1) create assets
2) upload images to ipfs
3) create metadata for assets following ERC-721 Json spec
4) upload metadata files to folder on ipfs
5) create sha256 hash for each of the metadata files
6) concate each of the hash strings in order and create another sha256 hash, this is the provenance hash

Part 2 - Contract deployment and setup

1) deploy with contract parameters including provenance hash. By default this will put the contract in a non-minting state and starting index is at random.
2) start any gifting nfts by calling the gift function
3) open presale by calling goPresaleLive function
4) open sale by calling goLive function. Once main sale is live, presale will no longer work

Part 3 - During and Post Minting

1) during minting, nfts can be created for the set price durring minting. Minting is done by calling the mint function
2) update baseTokenUri to set the location of the assets. this is done by calling setBaseUri function
3) can then withdraw contract funds by calling the withdraw function
